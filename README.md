# select2-tailwindcss

select2-tailwindcss is a Tailwind CSS Stylesheet for the Select2 selectbox. The example style is located in the /src/css folder. Please take a look for the Tailwind CSS classes I used. If you want a working example installed locally in your own dev environment, please follow the next instructions. 

## Prerequisites

You need Node and NPM globally installed from https://nodejs.org/en/download/
You need to install live-server to be able to start a local preview in your browser. Install live-server with: 'npm install -g live-server'

## Installation

To make a working test on your local dev environment, clone this repository and install the dependencies: 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Xibel/select2-tailwindcss.git
cd select2-tailwindcss
npm install
```

## Usage

Compile the Tailwind CSS Style with
```bash
npm run build
```
## Run the test website

```bash
live-server build
```
Your default browser should open and show an example page with a selectbox styled with Tailwind CSS. The styling code itself is in the /build/css/style.css file.
